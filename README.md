# Unity Raycast Detection Zone

This repository contains a Unity project demonstrating how to create expandable detection zones using raycasting. The provided script allows you to cast rays from a GameObject's position and visualize the detection zone's expansion. It's a great way to understand how to create interactive areas in your Unity projects.

## Features

- Cast rays from a GameObject's position.
- Visualize raycasts with debug lines.
- Create expandable detection zones.
- Adjust the size of the detection zone.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
git clone https://github.com/ShalvexNovachrono/Unity-Raycast-Detection-Zone.git
2. Open the Unity project in the Unity Editor.
3. Navigate to the `RayCastScript.cs` script located in the `Assets/Scripts` directory or any where else you might have put it too.
4. Attach the script to a GameObject in your scene.
5. Play the scene and observe how the raycast detection zone expands.

It should look something like this

## Usage

- Adjust the `size` and `sizeIncreaseNumber` variables to control the initial size and rate of expansion of the detection zone.
- Experiment with different GameObject positions and rotation to see how the detection zone changes.
